In less than 8 years of existence, the platform:

The evolution per month over time is:

From the graphs above, we can see a direct relationship between `$USD` and number of `backers`.

On the other hand, sometimes there is a big difference between number of `backers` and `projects`, caused by having this month some of the [most backed projects](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?sort=most_backed&seed=2553607&page=1) sharing campaign: for instance in October 2016, this big gap is a result of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/bears-vs-babies-a-card-game?ref=discovery) + [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antsylabs/fidget-cube-a-vinyl-desk-toy?ref=discovery).

Same for `USD` and `projects`: there was a very successful and expensive game ([this beauty](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poots/kingdom-death-monster-15?ref=most_funded&ref=discovery)) launching in November 2016.

Dance and Theater are the most succesful categories and, curiously, Technology is the least succesful one!

> Tip 2: It is never too late to fulfill your stage dreams.

Not that easy!

Taking out non-successful campaigns and dividing each of those main categories into their secondaries (159), here are the Top 25 of them by `USD`:

And how the rank changed the last 5 years:

> Tip 3: Project design is what makes a project succesful. 

People has increasingly investing on non-technological stuff! Too much computers during the day maybe and prefer analog hobbies?

And WOW! it is really impressive how much money is spent on Board Games in KS! Let's take a deeper look on that.
